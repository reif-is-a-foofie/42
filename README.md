# 42

42 is an autonomous, self-learning AI system.
It ingests, compresses, and exploits knowledge to reason and act.
The goal is a local loop of perception, memory, and morally aligned execution.

```
Sensory -> Reflex -> Brain -> Memory -> Muscles -> Soul
    |        |        |       |         |        |
42.un    Queue    42.deux  DB    Actions   Conscience
```

### Self-Tuning Embeddings Subsystem

Classical (Mistral/LoRA) → Quantum (PennyLane + CUDA-Q) → Alexandrian Memory → RL Feedback → Self-tuning loop.
Uses PEFT, Triplet Learning, and RLHF for continuous fine-tuning. Embedding refinement drives smarter quantum reasoning and symbolic alignment.

## Version Roadmap

- **42.zéro** – baseline CLI/API with vector memory
- **42.un** – reflex loop via Redis and automated ingestion
- **42.deux** – Bayesian optimization and knowledge graphs
- **42.trois** – autonomous reinforcement and continuous learning
- **42.quatre** – multi-agent orchestration and contextual pruning

## Quick Start

Install the core dependencies (Redis, Qdrant, HDBSCAN, BoTorch, PennyLane, CUDA-Q, RLlib) and then:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
42          # prints a welcome message with setup tips
42 start    # launches the API and vector store
42 up       # alternative foreground start
42 e=mc^2   # example one-liner
42 import ./src
42 ask "How does the server start?"
```

See `TASKS.md` for the detailed development plan.
