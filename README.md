# MASTERPLAN 42 - Autonomous Intelligence Platform

*42 aims to evolve into a digital organism capable of reasoning and acting without constant human supervision*

## 🧠 **Vision**

The design borrows from the human body: `42.un` handles sensors, a reflex layer uses Redis for fast reactions, and `42.deux` and `42.trois` serve as the analytic brain and reinforcement center. Memories accumulate in Alexandrian, a Qdrant-based vector store, while a conscience module filters every decision.

The internal runtime orchestrates all components. Incoming events first hit the Redis bus. The main loop scores each task with a Bayesian filter and quantum solver, builds reasoning chains via knowledge graphs, and executes them through action agents. Meanwhile `42.trois` continually trains a reinforcement loop that compresses embeddings via HDBSCAN. This self-learning loop refines priorities and prunes outdated memories.

In parallel, the system follows a plugin-first philosophy: every module wraps a trusted library and exposes a small interface. This keeps 42 lean and simplifies upgrades.
