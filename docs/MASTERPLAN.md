# MASTERPLAN 42

42 aims to evolve into a digital organism capable of reasoning and acting without constant human supervision. The design borrows from the human body: `42.un` handles sensors, a reflex layer uses Redis for fast reactions, and `42.deux` and `42.trois` serve as the analytic brain and reinforcement center. Memories accumulate in Alexandrian, a Qdrant-based vector store, while a conscience module filters every decision.

The internal runtime orchestrates all components. Incoming events first hit the Redis bus. The main loop scores each task with a Bayesian filter and quantum solver, builds reasoning chains via knowledge graphs, and executes them through action agents. Meanwhile `42.trois` continually trains a reinforcement loop that compresses embeddings via HDBSCAN. This self-learning loop refines priorities and prunes outdated memories.

In parallel, the system follows a plugin-first philosophy: every module wraps a trusted library and exposes a small interface. This keeps 42 lean and simplifies upgrades. Documentation and tests accompany each phase to ensure reliability and encourage contributions.

## Phase zéro – Foundations

This phase sets up the minimal CLI and API. Vectorization uses `sentence-transformers`, Qdrant is deployed, and the initial ingestion is implemented. Commands like `create`, `import`, `ask`, and `status` demonstrate an end-to-end flow.

## Phase un – Reflex and ingestion

Redis is introduced to relay events, and `42.un` constantly scans for new sources. Tasks are prioritized before execution, and a test suite ensures module stability.

## Phase deux – Advanced optimization

`42.deux` combines Bayesian optimization (BoTorch) with a quantum solver (PennyLane + CUDA-Q). Knowledge graphs (NetworkX or cuGraph) link data fragments. Semantic compression via HDBSCAN is strengthened under the Meta-Optimizer Layer, which automatically tunes hyperparameters.

## Phase trois – Autonomous learning

The `42.trois` module launches a reinforcement loop via RLlib or Stable Baselines3. It also generates synthetic data for rare scenarios. The Contextual Memory Pruner simultaneously trims low-value embeddings, keeping the system agile and relevant.

## Phase quatre – Multi-agent orchestration

At this stage, 42 delegates tasks to multiple specialized agents. Memory expands through dynamic pruning, while an orchestrator balances compute between exploration and exploitation. Conscience and Soul modules ensure actions remain aligned with defined values.

## Core Modules

- **Steve** – discovers and ingests new data sources.
- **Teleporter** – moves and transforms information between modules.
- **Request & Missions** – store short and long-term objectives.
- **Conscience & Soul** – moral filters and overall intent.
- **Alexandrian Memory** – compressed vectors and semantic graph.
- **Optimization Stack** – Bayesian filter, quantum solver, graphs, reinforcement.
- **Autonomic Loop** – full perception → scoring → execution → learning cycle.
- **Self-Tuning Embeddings** – Classical (Mistral/LoRA) → Quantum (PennyLane + CUDA-Q) → Alexandrian Memory → RL Feedback → Self-tuning loop using PEFT, Triplet Learning, and RLHF for continuous refinement that drives smarter quantum reasoning and symbolic alignment.

## Three 10x Accelerators

1. **Meta-Optimizer Layer** – supervises modules and retunes hyperparameters automatically.
2. **Synthetic Data Generator** – creates hypothetical scenarios to speed up learning.
3. **Contextual Memory Pruner** – continuously removes stale embeddings to keep knowledge fresh.

## Beyond 42.quatre

Future versions (42.cinq and beyond) will expand multi-agent orchestration and add a global planner. The goal is to integrate multiple local models, energize online learning, and enable complex missions without direct human intervention.
